<h2>Midrub CMS</h2>

<p>Midrub CMS is the most advanced CMS platform.</p>

<br>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Midrub CMS  is a CMS platform, created mainly for business but it could be used even for personal use like a website or blog. It has features to provide SAAS services and features to create a blog or website.</p>
<p>Midrub CMS is the most advanced because it has all essential features to provide SAAS services and it allows to be customized in the most advanced way possible without affecting other features.</p>
<p>The CMS has 4 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend - to create the frontend it has frontend themes with advanced features. The themes content could be managed from the administrator panel.</li>
<li>Auth - this section contains the Sign In, SignUp, Reset Password, Change Password and Page components. You could custom these components to be as you need. The components content could be managed from the administrator panel. Both Sign In and Sign Up component allows to use a slider, logo and social login with dynamic features.</li>
<li>User - this section is for users. It could be used to provide SAAS services with the features limited by plan. For the user's panel the CMS has themes and them could be used to show the styles, menu and sidebars. The user's themes are more limited comparing with the frontend themes. To sell services the user's section has apps which could be used to provide services based on the user's plan. The apps are adding options in the Plans pages from the administrator's panel and the administrator is able to manage the limits. The user's panel has even components which could be used as simply pages or common features which are available for all plans. The components don't have the components word in the url like the apps and can't be limited by plan.</li>
<li>Administrator - this section allows to manage all other sections: Frontend, Auth and User. In the administrator panel is possible to manage the notifications for the user's panel, manage content and options in the sections(Frontend, Auth and User), install (new components for user's panel, apps for user's panel, networks for user's panel, themes for user's panel, themes for frontend section, plugins), update(components for user's panel, apps for user's panel, networks for user's panel, themes for user's panel, themes for frontend section, plugins) and configure all available features. The administrator is able even to manage the members, see the transactions, print the invoices, generate coupon codes, create api's apps, reply to support tickets and manage the support center for the user's panel. The administrator is able even to manage the menu for the user's panel and frontend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both themes, components and apps are used to display content. But the CMS has support even for hooks, for them we have even the plugins. The plugins in the Midrub CMS are used to add new features by using the hooks. The hooks could be used to display even content but only in the existing components and apps. I have created several plugins which could be used to translate all platform in multiple languages, store and manage the files in Amazon S3 and change the platform's icons with several clicks to be used forever even if new features are installed.</p>
<p>The api feature in the Midrub CMS allows to add easy the api support to any installed app. You could in several minutes to create a new endpoint which will be used in an app.</p>
<p>The integrated payment system allows you to integrate any kind of payments gateways with all its webhooks requests and recurring payments. By default the Midrub CMS has PayPal, Stripe and Braintree. But anyone could add new payments gateways. For payments we have too themes. These themes could be customized but is required to install them manually.</p>

<h4>Structure</h4>

<p>The most important point in the Midrub CMS is possibly to edit any feature without affecting other. You could remove, replace or install any components, apps, themes and plugins without affecting the core(if you're following the rules).</p>
<p>The installation of components, apps, themes and plugins could be done easily from the administrator panel and you could update them from the same administrator panel.</p>
<p>The apps in the Midrub CMS allows to provide any kind of service. With an app you could add restrictions options in the plans to be managed by the administrator for the app, add options in the user settings page, add restrictions in the teams roles, add api support, add options in the user's panel, add support for cron job requests, add support for webhooks requests and use the hooks of the administrator section, user section and frontend section.</p>
<p>The menu could be managed from the administrator panel. And managed even if you have multiple languages. Midrub CMS allows to have the features in multiple languages and even the content created from the administrator panel. You could create menu in multiple languages, add quick guides, support articles, contents in frontend and menu in frontend in multiple languages. </p>
<p>The api will be used in all installed apps and components. The cron jobs requests could be used in all installed apps. The webhooks requests could be used in all installed apps. The ajax could be customized separately to be used in any component, theme, plugin, payment gateway or app.</p>
<p>All icons in the user's panel and administrator's panel could be changed with several clicks. I have a plugin which allows you to change the icons and your changed icons will be used forever in any component, theme or app.</p>
<p>All colors and fonts could be modified from one file. All elements are using the css libraries. You could custom any element from one of these libraries and you will have forever your customizations.</p>
<p>In this CMS you have the possibility to create feature to support high traffic. It has functions to save the database queries to the cache and with the hooks you could control the cache when new data is added or updated.</p>
<p>The plans allow to have control on anything in the user's panel. Since the version 0.0.8.5 the plans could be used even with multiple languages.</p>
